/// # Pitfalls
///
/// Server-Sent Events suffer from certain pitfalls. We encourage readers to
/// read through [pitfalls](struct@EventStream#pitfalls) before making use of
/// Rocket's SSE support.
///
/// # Comments
///
/// A server-sent _comment_, created via [`Event::comment()`], is an event that
/// appears only in the raw server-sent event data stream and is inaccessible by
/// most clients. This includes JavaScript's `EventSource`. As such, they serve
/// little utility beyond debugging a raw data stream and keeping a connection
/// alive. See [hearbeat](struct@EventStream#heartbeat) for information on
/// Rocket's `EventStream` keep-alive.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// A server-sent field can be one of four kinds:
///
///   * `retry`
///
///     A `retry` event, created via [`Event::retry()`], sets the reconnection
///     time on the client side. It is the duration the client will wait before
///     attempting to reconnect when a connection is lost. Most applications
///     will not need to set a `retry`, opting instead to use the
///     implementation's default or to reconnect manually on error.
///
///   * `id`
///
///     Sets the event id to associate all subsequent fields with. This value
///     cannot be retrieved directly via most clients, including JavaScript
///     `EventSource`. Instead, it is sent by the implementation on reconnection
///     via the `Last-Event-ID` header. An `id` can be attached to other fields
///     via the [`Event::id()`] builder method.
///
///   * `event`
///
///     Sets the event name to associate the next `data` field with. In
///     JavaScript's `EventSource`, this is the event to be listened for, which
///     defaults to `message`. An `event` can be attached to other fields via
///     the [`Event::event()`] builder method.
///
///   * `data`
///
///     Sends data to dispatch as an event at the client. In JavaScript's
///     `EventSource`, this (and only this) results in an event handler for
///     `event`, specified just prior, being triggered. A data field can be
///     created via the [`Event::data()`] or [`Event::json()`] constructors.
///
/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// A constructed `Event` _always_ emits its fields in the following order:
///
///   1. `comment`
///   2. `retry`
///   3. `id`
///   4. `event`
///   5. `data`
///
/// The `event` and `id` fields _cannot_ contain new lines or carriage returns.
/// Rocket's default implementation automatically converts new lines and
/// carriage returns in `event` and `id` fields to spaces.
///
/// The `data` and `comment` fields _cannot_ contain carriage returns. Rocket
/// converts the unencoded sequence `\r\n` and the isolated `\r` into a
/// protocol-level `\n`, that is, in such a way that they are interpreted as
/// `\n` at the client. For example, the raw message `foo\r\nbar\rbaz` is
/// received as `foo\nbar\nbaz` at the client-side. Encoded sequences, such as
/// those emitted by [`Event::json()`], have no such restrictions.

///
/// [`Stream`]: https://docs.rs/futures/0.3/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html
///
/// # Responder
///
/// `EventStream` is a (potentially infinite) responder. The response
/// `Content-Type` is set to [`EventStream`](ContentType::EventStream). The body
/// is [unsized](crate::response::Body#unsized), and values are sent as soon as
/// they are yielded by the internal iterator.
///
/// ## Heartbeat
///
/// A heartbeat comment is injected into the internal stream and sent at a fixed
/// interval. The comment is discarded by clients and serves only to keep the
/// connection alive; it does not interfere with application data. The interval
/// defaults to 30 seconds but can be adjusted with
/// [`EventStream::heartbeat()`].
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Use [`EventStream!`] to yield an infinite series of "ping" SSE messages to
/// the client, one per second:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use rocket::*;
/// use rocket::response::stream::{Event, EventStream};;
/// use rocket::tokio::time::{self, Duration};
///
/// #[get("/events")]
/// fn stream() -> EventStream![] {
///     EventStream! {
///         let mut interval = time::interval(Duration::from_secs(1));
///         loop {
///             yield Event::data("ping");
///             interval.tick().await;
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Yield 9 events: 3 triplets of `retry`, `data`, and `comment` events:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use rocket::get;
/// use rocket::response::stream::{Event, EventStream};
/// use rocket::tokio::time::Duration;
///
/// #[get("/events")]
/// fn events() -> EventStream![] {
///     EventStream! {
///         for i in 0..3 {
///             yield Event::retry(Duration::from_secs(10));
///             yield Event::data(format!("{}", i)).id("cat").event("bar");
///             yield Event::comment("silly boy");
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The syntax of `EventStream!` as an expression is identical to that of
/// [`stream!`](crate::response::stream::stream). For how to gracefully
/// terminate an otherwise infinite stream, see [graceful
/// shutdown](crate::response::stream#graceful-shutdown).
///
/// # Borrowing
///
/// If an `EventStream` contains a borrow, the extended type syntax
/// `EventStream![Event + '_]` must be used:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use rocket::get;
/// use rocket::State;
/// use rocket::response::stream::{Event, EventStream};
///
/// #[get("/events")]
/// fn events(ctxt: &State<bool>) -> EventStream![Event + '_] {
///     EventStream! {
///         // By using `ctxt` in the stream, the borrow is moved into it. Thus,
///         // the stream object contains a borrow, prompting the '_ annotation.
///         if *ctxt.inner() {
///             yield Event::data("hi");
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// See [`stream#borrowing`](crate::response::stream#borrowing) for further
/// details on borrowing in streams.
///
/// # Pitfalls
///
/// Server-Sent Events are a rather simple mechanism, though there are some
/// pitfalls to be aware of.
///
///  * **Buffering**
///
///    Protocol restrictions complicate implementing an API that does not
///    buffer. As such, if you are sending _lots_ of data, consider sending the
///    data via multiple data fields (with events to signal start and end).
///    Alternatively, send _one_ event which instructs the client to fetch the
///    data from another endpoint which in-turn streams the data.
///
///  * **Raw SSE requires UTF-8 data**
///
///    Only UTF-8 data can be sent via SSE. If you need to send arbitrary bytes,
///    consider encoding it, for instance, as JSON using [`Event::json()`].
///    Alternatively, as described before, use SSE as a notifier which alerts
///    the client to fetch the data from elsewhere.
///
///  * **Raw SSE is Lossy**
///
///    Data sent via SSE cannot contain new lines `\n` or carriage returns `\r`
///    due to interference with the line protocol.
///
///    The protocol allows expressing new lines as multiple messages, however,
///    and Rocket automatically transforms a message of `foo\nbar` into two
///    messages, `foo` and `bar`, so that they are reconstructed (automatically)
///    as `foo\nbar` on the client-side. For messages that only contain new
///    lines `\n`, the conversion is lossless.
///
///    However, the protocol has no mechanism for expressing carriage returns
///    and thus it is not possible to send unencoded carriage returns via SSE.
///    Rocket handles carriage returns like it handles new lines: it splits the
///    data into multiple messages. Thus, a sequence of `\r\n` becomes `\n` at
///    the client side. A single `\r` that is not part of an `\r\n` sequence
///    also becomes `\n` at the client side. As a result, the message
///    `foo\r\nbar\rbaz` is read as `foo\nbar\nbaz` at the client-side.
///
///    To send messages losslessly, they must be encoded first, for instance, by
///    using [`Event::json()`].
