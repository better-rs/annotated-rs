title = "Hello, Rocket!"
code = '''
  #![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

  #[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

  #[get("/hello/<name>/<age>")]
  fn hello(name: String, age: u8) -> String {
      format!("Hello, {} year old named {}!", age, name)
  }

  fn main() {
      rocket::ignite().mount("/", routes![hello]).launch();
  }
'''
text = '''
  This is a **complete Rocket application**. It does exactly what you would
  expect. If you were to visit **http://localhost:8000/hello/John/58**, you’d
  see:

  <span class="callout">Hello, 58 year old named John!</span>

  If someone visits a path with an `<age>` that isn’t a `u8`, Rocket doesn’t
  blindly call `hello`. Instead, it tries other matching routes or returns a
  **404**.

[[sections]]
title = "Forms? Check!"
code = '''
  #[derive(FromForm)]
  struct Task {
     description: String,
     completed: bool
  }

  #[post("/", data = "<task>")]
  fn new(task: Form<Task>) -> Flash<Redirect> {
      if task.description.is_empty() {
          Flash::error(Redirect::to("/"), "Cannot be empty.")
      } else {
          Flash::success(Redirect::to("/"), "Task added.")
      }
  }
'''
text = '''
  Handling forms **is simple and easy**. Simply derive `FromForm` for your
  structure and let Rocket know which parameter to use. Rocket **parses and
  validates** the form request, creates the structure, and calls your function.

  Bad form request? Rocket doesn’t call your function! What if you want to know
  if the form was bad? Simple! Change the type of `task` to `Option` or
  `Result`!

[[sections]]
title = "JSON, out of the box."
code = '''
  #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
  struct Message {
     contents: String,
  }

  #[put("/<id>", data = "<msg>")]
  fn update(db: &Db, id: Id, msg: Json<Message>) -> JsonValue {
      if db.contains_key(&id) {
          db.insert(id, &msg.contents);
          json!({ "status": "ok" })
      } else {
          json!({ "status": "error" })
      }
  }
'''
text = '''
  Rocket has first-class support for JSON, right out of the box. Simply derive
  `Deserialize` or `Serialize` to receive or return JSON, respectively.

  Like other important features, JSON works through Rocket’s `FromData` trait,
  Rocket’s approach to deriving types from body data. It works like this:
  specify a `data` route parameter of any type that implements `FromData`. A
  value of that type will then be created automatically from the incoming
  request body. Best of all, you can implement `FromData` for your types!
