/// An error catching route.
///
/// Catchers are routes that run when errors occur. They correspond directly
/// with the HTTP error status code they will be handling and are registered
/// with Rocket via [`Rocket::register()`](::Rocket::register()). For example,
/// to handle "404 not found" errors, a catcher for the "404" status code is
/// registered.
///
/// Because error handlers are only called when all routes are exhausted, they
/// should not fail nor forward. If an error catcher fails, the user will
/// receive no response. If an error catcher forwards, Rocket will respond with
/// an internal server error.
///
/// # Built-In Catchers
///
/// Rocket has many built-in, pre-registered default catchers. In particular,
/// Rocket has catchers for all of the following status codes: 400, 401, 402,
/// 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417,
/// 418, 421, 426, 428, 429, 431, 451, 500, 501, 503, and 510. As such, catchers
/// only need to be registered if an error needs to be handled in a custom
/// fashion.
///
/// # Code Generation
///
/// Catchers should rarely be used directly. Instead, they are typically
/// declared using the `catch` decorator, as follows:
///
/// ```rust
/// #![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]
///
/// #[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
///
/// use rocket::Request;
///
/// #[catch(500)]
/// fn internal_error() -> &'static str {
///     "Whoops! Looks like we messed up."
/// }
///
/// #[catch(404)]
/// fn not_found(req: &Request) -> String {
///     format!("I couldn't find '{}'. Try something else?", req.uri())
/// }
///
/// fn main() {
/// # if false { // We don't actually want to launch the server in an example.
///     rocket::ignite().register(catchers![internal_error, not_found]).launch();
/// # }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A function decorated with `catch` must take exactly zero or one arguments.
/// If the catcher takes an argument, it must be of type [`&Request`](Request).
